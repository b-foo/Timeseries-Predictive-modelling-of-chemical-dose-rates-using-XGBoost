Background
A typical time series dataset queried from the enterprise data historian has been provided. It consists of multiple water quality parameters (Columns A to J) that have been input by plant operators manually, as well as dose rates (DOSE) of chemicals that have been set to run a particular water treatment process for 10 different plants (PLANT P01 to P10) located along the same river.

Task
Your job as a data scientist is to create a regression model to predict the possible range of chemical dose rates that the operators should be operating within, as well as the most recommended dose rate.

Deliverables
1) Documentation (MS Powerpoint preferred) addressing the following:
• Overview of modelling process
• Exploratory analysis of data
• Methods of outlier detection and other data cleaning steps
• Model selection and validation process
• Selection of accuracy metric(s) and prediction accuracy achieved
• Explanation of variables that are most important to predicting dose rates
• Description of how such a dosing model can be implemented, monitored and utilized
• Proposal of any other methods that can be pursued
2) Programming scripts:
• Can be in any programming language of your choice
• Can be in executable or notebook format where appropriate
• Should be:
i) Be as readable as possible (e.g. commented appropriately, using variable/object names that make sense)
ii) Import all libraries/modules/toolboxes used
iii) Include a final prediction file (predicting on the entire dataset) and save it as “assessment_result.csv”, with 3 additional columns: recommended dose (PRED) and possible range (PRED_HIGH & PRED_LOW) that it should be within.
